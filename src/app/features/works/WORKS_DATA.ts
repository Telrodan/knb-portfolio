      'To construct a full-stack to-do list application, I utilized Node.js as the back-end and Angular as the front-end. The program has a straightforward and user-friendly interface that allows users to create, view, and manage tasks. I created a dynamic and responsive user interface using Angular`s component-based design. For the backend, I built a RESTful API in Node.js that handles all data processing and interacts with the database.',
